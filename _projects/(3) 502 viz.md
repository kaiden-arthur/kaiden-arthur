# Pokemon Battle Assistant 

For the final project in my Data Visualization class, my group created a tool that can be used when playing Pokemon games. 

### Project Concept 

When playing Pokemon games, an important element of the combat is the type matchups that affect how much damage a Pokemon's move does. We found the currently-existing type chart clunky and hard to read, so decided to make an interactive version. This allows players to easily determine which moves will be effective in a given matchup without having to look at a dense table. 

### Skills Used 

- R
    - GGPlot
    - Shiny app

### Project Result

Our final tool is available as a Shiny app that contains both the type matchup chart and a stat comparison of the selected Pokemon. Only Pokemon from the first 6 generations (through the Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire games from 2014) are included; this is a limitation of the dataset used in this project.
