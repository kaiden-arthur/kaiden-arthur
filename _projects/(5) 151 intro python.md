# Space Invaders! 

Building on the work done in the graphics library PGL over the course of my introductory Python course, my final project was to recreate a (very memory-intensive) version of the arcade game Space Invaders. 

This was the first project I planned and executed myself in Python. It will freeze up very quickly because it isn't well-optimized at all, but it still makes for a fun play (or you can comment out a few lines and watch the animations).
