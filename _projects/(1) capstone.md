# Trimet Usage Data

For my capstone project in the MSDS program, I worked with TriMet's Spring 2025 usage data and schedule information, focusing on predicting usage of a given stop based on some features extrapolated from the schedule.

### Workflow and Skills Used
My section of the data collection process focused on webscraping schedule data from the TriMet website, using requests and BeautifulSoup. 

##### This project is still ongoing! Check back in late August to see what we found out ;)
